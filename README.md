```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Yarn or pnpm

### Installation & Setup

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

2. **Start local blockchain**

   ```bash
   yarn chain
   ```

   Keep this terminal open - it runs your local Hardhat network.

3. **Deploy contracts** (in a new terminal)

   ```bash
   yarn deploy
   ```

   This deploys the RPSOnline contract to your local network.

4. **Start frontend** (in a new terminal)
   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```
   Frontend runs on `http://localhost:3000`

## 🎯 How to Play

### Current Implementation (On-Chain)

1. **Connect Wallet**: Use any wallet (MetaMask recommended)
2. **Set Username**: Edit username in header
3. **Create Room**: Generate room code with ETH bet amount
4. **Share Code**: Give the room code to your opponent
5. **Join Room**: Enter room code and match bet amount
6. **Commit Move**: Submit encrypted move on-chain
7. **Reveal Move**: Reveal your move to determine winner
8. **Claim Prize**: Winner claims the full pot

### Game Rules

- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock
- Same moves = Tie (both players get refund)
- Winner takes full pot (2x bet amount)
- Loser loses their bet

## 🔧 Development Commands

```bash
# Blockchain
yarn chain          # Start local Hardhat network
yarn deploy         # Deploy contracts to local network
yarn deploy:sepolia # Deploy to Base Sepolia testnet

# Frontend
yarn start          # Start Next.js development server
yarn build          # Build for production
yarn lint           # Run ESLint

# Full stack
yarn dev            # Start frontend (same as yarn start)
```
